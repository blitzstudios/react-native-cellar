/**
 * Caches for values a store computes from its table rows, each holding a fixed number of entries.
 *
 * A store's rows live in SQLite, and every query returns new objects, so anything computed from them (a view model, a
 * ranking, a lookup map) would be rebuilt on every read without a cache. A cache keeps each computed value together
 * with the version of the rows it was computed from, and returns it until those rows change: a {@linkcode byPartition}
 * cache until any write to its partition (the set of rows one fetch returns and replaces), a {@linkcode byEntity} cache
 * until a write changes its entity's rows (an entity is the thing a row belongs to, such as one player, named by the
 * table's `entityId` column). When a value is rebuilt and `isEqual` finds it equal to the previous one, the previous
 * object is kept, so readers don't re-render. Stores declare their caches in one block,
 * {@linkcode Partitions.defineCaches | defineCaches}.
 *
 * The per-partition machinery underneath is a memo: {@linkcode byPartition}'s entries, and {@linkcode entityMemo},
 * which holds a {@linkcode byEntity} cache's values.
