/**
 * {@linkcode byEntity} caches: a value derived from each entity's rows, usually a view model, cached per entity.
 *
 * An entity is the thing a row belongs to, such as one player, named by the table's `entityId` column. Derived values
 * turn an entity's rows into a value (typically the object a screen renders), keep it, and return the same object until
 * a write changes that entity's rows. Rows come out of SQLite as new objects on every query, so without this, every
 * read after every write would build new values and re-render every component showing one, changed or not.
 *
 * Every write reports which entities it changed, so only those entities' values are rebuilt. A read that asks for
 * particular entities ({@linkcode DerivedValues.at | at}, {@linkcode DerivedValues.atEach | atEach}) depends on just
 * those entities, so a write to other entities doesn't re-run it. A store declares one set of derived values per shape,
 * and every read of that shape shares it, so each entity's value is built once however many reads ask for it.
 *
 * Every method's answer is cached, lists included: asked again, a method returns the same array or object for as long
 * as what it holds is unchanged, and {@linkcode DerivedValues.where | where} and {@linkcode DerivedValues.all | all}
 * keep which entities matched until the partition changes, so asking again runs no query.
